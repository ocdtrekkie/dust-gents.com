This is the website code from the former DUST 514 Alliance, Top Men. Much of it is no longer useful or functional as it was built on two different legacy API technologies that CCP has since retired. Features included allowing forum users to verify against their in-game characters using the EVE Mail system, seeing planetary conquest district status, and being able to enter upcoming matches into the calendar. The code for the site, written by Soraya Xel, and the Planetary Conquest System, written by Flammarion, was integrated with phpBB3.x and the CoDFaction theme.
