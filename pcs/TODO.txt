TODOs

Feedback from Soraya:
Possible workflow:
- Add Event
- Input time, event type, platoon leader, sponsoring corp into the form.
- Thread in forum auto-created with all info in first post.
- Event created in table with calendar info and link to thread.
That way, we don't really need an edit ability so much as a delete ability. Events deleted or passed could  even have
their threads automatically moved from Upcoming Events to the Recycle Bin board, if we wanted to get fancy.
Regarding time entry/display, as noted, I'd like to enter and display EVE time in 24h format, though people's local
display should be 12h. It also might not be a bad idea to have events list the hours/minutes until the event in a
column as well. As of the page load, of course.

- Validate that new upcoming event date is in the future
- Default values for add event form (current month, date and year). Time should be empty by default.
- Keep form values after failed validation and display them in form
- Icons instead of big buttons for Edit and Delete
- View event page
- Events archive
- Replace date controls with calendar popup
- Add timezone selector to add event (defaults to EVE/GMT)
- Add optional description to event
- Icons for event types
- Add another types of events - FW?
- District location validation?
- Platoon commander field for event
- Requested roles for event
- Ability to submit applications for open roles for the event
